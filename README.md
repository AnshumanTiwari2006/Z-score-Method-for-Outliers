🕵️‍♂️ Outlier Detection & Removal using the Z-Score Method
A foundational data preprocessing technique for identifying and managing extreme values using the Z-Score (3-Sigma) Rule
✅ Best suited for features that follow — or closely resemble — a normal (Gaussian) distribution

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to detect and handle outliers in a numerical feature using statistical principles rooted in the properties of the normal distribution. The analysis focuses on the income column from a customer dataset, applying the widely used Z-score method to ensure data quality before modeling.

The Jupyter Notebook guides you through a structured workflow:

📊 Data Loading & Initial Inspection: Load the dataset and examine the size and basic characteristics of the target column
📈 Distribution Check: Visualize the data using histograms and compute skewness to assess suitability for Z-score-based treatment
🧮 Statistical Boundary Setup: Use the mean and standard deviation to define outlier thresholds based on the 3-Sigma Rule
🧹 Outlier Management: Apply two standard strategies — removal or capping — to address extreme values
🔍 Final Validation: Confirm the impact of treatment using summary statistics to ensure outliers no longer distort the data

📥 Installation
All required libraries can be installed with a single pip command:

pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib

💡 Tip: Use a virtual environment to maintain clean, isolated dependencies.

📁 Dataset
The analysis uses a sample customer dataset named Outlier.csv.

Primary Feature: income — a numerical column representing customer earnings
Supporting Features: age, gender, days_on_platform, and purchases (used for context, not modified)
While the Z-score method assumes near-normality, the notebook includes diagnostic checks to evaluate whether the data meets this condition before proceeding.

📐 Z-Score Method Explained
The Z-score quantifies how far a data point lies from the mean, measured in units of standard deviation.

According to the Empirical (3-Sigma) Rule:

~68% of data falls within ±1σ
~95% within ±2σ
~99.7% within ±3σ
Thus, any observation beyond ±3 standard deviations from the mean is considered statistically rare and flagged as an outlier.

🔢 Key Insight
Even if a feature isn’t perfectly normal, the Z-score method can still be useful when the distribution is reasonably symmetric — though results should always be validated visually and statistically.

🧹 Outlier Handling Strategies

✂️ Trimming (Removal)
Records with income values outside the ±3σ range are excluded from the dataset. This reduces the total sample size but ensures extreme values don’t influence analysis.

❌ Trade-off: Simplicity vs. potential loss of valuable observations

🧢 Capping (Winsorization)
Instead of deletion, extreme income values are adjusted to the nearest statistical boundary (upper or lower limit). This retains all rows while neutralizing the distorting effect of outliers.

✅ Recommended for machine learning pipelines where preserving sample size is critical

📈 Results & Validation
After applying capping:

The maximum and minimum values align precisely with the calculated 3-sigma limits
Summary statistics reflect a more stable, model-ready distribution
The influence of extreme outliers is effectively eliminated without discarding data
